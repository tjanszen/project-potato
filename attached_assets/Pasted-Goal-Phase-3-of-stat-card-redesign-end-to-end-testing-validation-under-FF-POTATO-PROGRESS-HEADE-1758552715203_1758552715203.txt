Goal: Phase 3 of stat card redesign — end-to-end testing & validation under FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2.

Context:
- Implementation plan: docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/stat_card_update.md
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2
- Phase 1: Icons imported + gated
- Phase 2: Card layout restructured (header at top, number+icon inline, “days” removed)
- Now validate functionality, responsiveness, and edge cases

Do:
- Test with FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=false:
  - Verify original UI (number → label → days text)
- Test with FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=true:
  - Verify new layout: header at top, number + icon inline, no “days”
- Validate responsive behavior:
  - Small screen widths (mobile)
  - Medium and large layouts
- Edge case testing:
  - Zero values for stats
  - Loading states (skeletons or spinners)
  - Error states (API failure, missing data)
- Accessibility validation:
  - Ensure icons have aria-labels or hidden appropriately
  - Headings and numbers are screen-reader friendly
- Add console log token: "Phase 3: Validation complete" once all tests pass

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:  
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")
- Never use individual frontend-only restarts

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (flag not toggling, >3 TS errors, repeated crashes, unmet prerequisites, infra failures):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates from agreed scope (new endpoints, schema changes, unrelated redesigns):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  → Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  → WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming  

Proof:
- With flag=false → Original UI unchanged
- With flag=true → New card layout shown correctly
- Responsive layouts verified visually in browser at different screen sizes
- Edge cases handled gracefully (zero, loading, error)
- Accessibility checks passed (labels/icons properly handled)
- Browser console shows: "Phase 3: Validation complete"
