Goal: Spike and create an implementation plan for redesigning the 3 stat cards in TotalsPanel to match new wireframe layout under feature flag FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2.

Context:
- Current implementation: 3 stat boxes (Current Run, Longest Run, Total Days) with number + “days” label
- Desired update (only when FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=true):
  - Header text at the top of each card
  - Number displayed below the header
  - Icon displayed to the right of the number
  - Remove “days” label entirely
  - Maintain order: Current Run → Longest Run → Total Days
  - Icons to use:
    - Current Run = running person
    - Longest Run = flame
    - Total Days = trophy
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2 (already exists, default=false)

Do:
- Investigate TotalsPanel.tsx code where stat boxes are rendered
- Document how each stat card is currently styled and laid out (grid/flexbox, internal structure)
- Identify where number + label rendering occurs
- Propose changes needed to:
  - Move header text to top
  - Render number below
  - Render icon to the right of the number
  - Remove “days” label
- Outline implementation plan (Phases) with feature flag gating
- No UI changes yet, spike only

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:  
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")
- Never use individual frontend-only restarts

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (missing components, >3 TS errors, repeated crashes, unmet prerequisites, infra failures):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates from agreed scope (new features, schema changes, unrelated refactors):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  → Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  → WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming  

Proof:
- Output must include:
  - Files/components identified
  - Current layout description
  - Where number + label rendering is handled
  - Proposed UI changes required
  - Phased plan for implementation under FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2
