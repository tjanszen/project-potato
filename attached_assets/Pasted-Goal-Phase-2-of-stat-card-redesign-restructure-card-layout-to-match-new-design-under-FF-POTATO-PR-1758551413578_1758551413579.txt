Goal: Phase 2 of stat card redesign — restructure card layout to match new design under FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2.

Context:
- Implementation plan documented in docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/stat_card_update.md
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2 (already exists and validated)
- Phase 1 complete: icons imported and test-rendered next to "days" text
- Now restructure card layout for the final design

Do:
- In client/src/components/TotalsPanel.tsx (within shouldRemoveHeader branch):
  - Move stat label text (e.g. "Current Run", "Longest Run", "Total Days") to the top of each card
  - Render number below the header
  - Render icon to the right of the number in a horizontal flex layout
  - Remove the “days” label entirely
  - Maintain existing background colors and styling per card
- Preserve backward compatibility:
  - Flag=false → Original UI unchanged
  - Flag=true → New card layout (header → number+icon)

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:  
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")
- Never use individual frontend-only restarts

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (missing components, >3 TS errors, repeated crashes, unmet prerequisites, infra failures):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates from agreed scope (new features, schema changes, unrelated refactors):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  → Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  → WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming  

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=false → UI unchanged (label under number, “days” text present, no icons)
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=true:
  - Each card shows header at top
  - Number displayed below header
  - Icon aligned to right of number
  - “days” text removed
- Browser visually matches wireframe mock
