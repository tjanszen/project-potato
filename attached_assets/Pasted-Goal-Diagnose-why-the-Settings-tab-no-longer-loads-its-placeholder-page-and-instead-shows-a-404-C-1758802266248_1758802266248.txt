Goal: Diagnose why the Settings tab no longer loads its placeholder page and instead shows a 404.

Context:
- The Settings tab used to work and display a placeholder page.
- Current behavior: Clicking the Settings tab in the BottomNav shows a 404 Page Not Found.
- No intentional removal of the Settings page was requested.
- BottomNav integration for Settings still appears in the UI, but the route may no longer resolve correctly.

Do:
1. Inspect client/src/AppRoutes.tsx:
   - Confirm if a <Route path="/settings"> exists and points to a valid SettingsPage component.
   - Verify if <AuthGuard> is applied consistently for the Settings route.

2. Inspect client/src/pages/ directory:
   - Confirm whether a SettingsPage.tsx file exists.
   - If it exists, check for recent changes that might affect rendering or exports.
   - If it does not exist, identify when/where it was removed.

3. Inspect BottomNav.tsx:
   - Verify that the "Settings" nav item points to path="/settings".
   - Ensure no mismatched casing or typos between the BottomNav path and the AppRoutes path.

4. Trace navigation behavior:
   - Add console logs to confirm which route path is triggered when clicking "Settings".
   - Check whether wouter is attempting to navigate to /settings or another route.

5. Summarize findings:
   - Explain why /settings currently resolves to 404.
   - Provide recommendations (e.g., re-add placeholder SettingsPage.tsx, fix AppRoutes, or adjust BottomNav path).

Workflows to Use:
- restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart") for consistent reproduction.
- If testing in production build, restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy").

Error Handling:
- If SettingsPage.tsx is missing, STOP and recommend re-adding it as a placeholder.
- If the route exists but isnâ€™t wired in AppRoutes.tsx, STOP and summarize the mismatch.
- If BottomNav path mismatch is detected, STOP and summarize the required fix.

Prompt Template Reminder:
- Do NOT use mark_completed_and_get_feedback (unreliable).
- Use console logs, server responses, and UI inspection to confirm findings.

Output Expected:
- Diagnosis of why Settings currently routes to 404.
- Specific recommended next step to restore placeholder Settings page functionality.
