DRAFT: Daily Postbrief - September 14, 2025

## Summary
Completed critical phases of React import standardization and dependency architecture consolidation to resolve TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useEffect') in GitHub Codespaces. Successfully achieved frontend compatibility across Replit and Codespaces environments through systematic import fixes, dependency isolation, and configuration reinforcement.

## Key Wins ‚úÖ
**Phase Progression Completed:**
- Phase 0 scan ‚Üí revealed 19/21 ‚ùå files missing React imports
- Phase 1 ‚Üí standardized imports across all 19 files
- Phase 1.5 ‚Üí analyzed vite.config.ts, found mismatch (auto runtime vs Codespaces reality)
- Phase 2 ‚Üí audited 12 component files, confirmed all now have React imports
- Phase 2.5 ‚Üí dependency hygiene audit revealed duplicate React declarations (root + client)
- Phase 2.5.1 ‚Üí consolidated React into client/package.json only, removed root copy, reduced LSP errors 447 ‚Üí 3
- Phase 2.75 Step-1 ‚Üí confirmed tsconfig.json uses react-jsx (automatic runtime)
- Phase 2.75 Step-3 ‚Üí updated vite.config.ts with React + ReactDOM aliases to enforce resolution from client/node_modules

**Architecture Achievements:**
- Dependency Isolation: Clean server/client separation with React only in client directory
- LSP Diagnostics: 99%+ error reduction (447 ‚Üí 3 remaining minor issues)
- Cross-Environment: Frontend builds successfully in both Replit and Codespaces
- Configuration Reinforcement: Multi-layered approach with explicit aliases and proper resolution paths

**Codespaces Environment:**
- Synced Codespaces to main branch
- Upgraded Node to v20
- Reinstalled dependencies successfully
- Started Vite development server successfully
- App now builds and frontend loads correctly at :5173 in Codespaces

## Blockers üö®
**Current Issue: Backend Not Running**
- Symptom: Login/signup flow fails with "Login Failed, Network Error"
- Root Cause: Backend (Express/Node) not running in Codespaces environment
- Impact: Frontend proxy configuration (/api, /health) to :3000 fails
- Severity: High - Prevents full application functionality testing

## Next Steps üìã
**Tomorrow's Action Items:**
1. Start Backend in Codespaces
   - Launch Express server on port 3000
   - Verify environment variables and database connectivity
2. Backend Health Check
   - Test /health endpoint responds correctly
   - Confirm API proxy routing from :5173 ‚Üí :3000
3. Authentication Flow Testing
   - Re-test login/signup functionality
   - Verify React import fixes resolve original TypeError
4. Phase 2.75 Runtime Validation
   - Complete remaining Phase 2.75 steps
   - Validate cross-environment compatibility end-to-end

**Status:** Frontend compatibility achieved ‚úÖ | Backend startup required for full validation ‚è≥
