Goal: Implement Phase 4 of the League Details Page plan (see docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_details_page.md). This phase adds the "Mark Completed" CTA to the League Details page.

Context:
- Phase 1 created backend `/api/leagues/:id/members`.
- Phase 2 created the LeagueDetailsPage and routing.
- Phase 3 made Active tab LeagueCards clickable, navigating to `/leagues/:id`.
- Now, the details page must allow users to mark a league as completed, reusing the existing CTA logic.

Do:
- Update `client/src/pages/LeagueDetailsPage.tsx`:
    - Import and use `useCompleteLeague` hook (already exists).
    - If `userMembership.completedAt === null`, show active CTA: "Mark Completed".
    - If `userMembership.completedAt !== null`, show disabled button: "Completed ✓".
    - On click of "Mark Completed", call `completeMutation.mutate(leagueId)`.
    - Ensure React Query invalidates `['leagues']` after completion so the Active tab updates automatically.
- Ensure CTA button behavior matches the Active tab (disabled once completed).
- Add test ID attributes:
    - `data-testid="button-mark-completed-${leagueId}"`
    - `data-testid="button-completed-${leagueId}"`

Proof:
- Logs: 
  - Server → `"Membership action=complete for user=<uuid>, league=<id>"`
  - Browser console → `"League marked as completed: <id>"`
- SQL:
  ```
  SELECT completed_at FROM league_memberships 
  WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email='tommyjanszen@gmail.com') 
  AND league_id = <id> AND is_active = true;
  ```
  → `completed_at` should be a timestamp after marking complete.
- Frontend Flow:
  - Open `/leagues/:id` for an active league → button shows "Mark Completed".
  - Click button → transitions to disabled "Completed ✓".
  - Navigate back to Active tab → LeagueCard shows "Completed ✓".
  - Reload `/leagues/:id` → persists as "Completed ✓".
- Idempotency:
  - Clicking "Completed ✓" again does nothing.

Workflows to Use:
- restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")

Scope Control:
- Do not add new backend endpoints or schema changes.
- Reuse existing `POST /api/leagues/:id/memberships { action: "complete" }`.
- STOP if additional backend changes appear necessary (not expected).
