Goal: Implement Phase 6 of the League Details Page plan (see docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_details_page.md). This phase adds a **Join CTA** for non-members on the League Details page.

Context:
- Current state (Phases 1–5): 
  - LeagueDetailsPage exists and shows league info + member list. 
  - For members, a “Mark Completed” CTA is available.
  - Non-members currently see no CTA.
- Requirement: 
  - Non-members should be able to view league details.
  - Instead of “Mark Completed” / “Completed”, they should see a **Join CTA**.
  - Once joined, the CTA should switch to “Mark Completed” (Phase 4 behavior).
  - League details (header, description, members list) must always be visible regardless of membership.

Do:
- Update `LeagueDetailsPage.tsx`:
  - Detect if user has an active membership (`userMembership?.isActive`).
  - If no membership, render a **Join CTA** button.
  - On click, call `POST /api/leagues/:id/memberships` (existing join logic).
  - After success:
    - Invalidate React Query cache for `['leagues']` and league details.
    - Switch CTA to “Mark Completed” (existing logic).
- Ensure non-members still see league info and members list, even before joining.

Proof:
- Logs:
  - Browser console → `"Join league requested: <id>"`
  - Server logs → `"Membership created for user=<uuid>, league=<id>"`
- SQL:
  ```sql
  SELECT is_active FROM league_memberships
  WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email='tommyjanszen@gmail.com')
  AND league_id = <id>;
  ```
  → `is_active = true` after joining.
- Frontend:
  - Visit `/leagues/:id` as non-member → see Join CTA.
  - Click Join → page refreshes → CTA becomes “Mark Completed”.
  - Active tab now shows league as joined.
- Feature flag: With `FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_DETAILS=false`, League Details page should remain hidden.

Workflows to Use:
- restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")

Scope Control:
- Do not add new backend endpoints or schema changes.
- Reuse existing join API.
- STOP if additional backend changes are required (not expected).
