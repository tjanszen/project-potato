Goal: Spike to investigate how to implement a new "Leagues" page with placeholder cards. Do not build UI yet — this is only to understand the codebase and draft a phased implementation plan.

Context:
- New feature: Leagues page under BottomNav (/leagues route placeholder already exists from FF_POTATO_BOTTOM_NAV work).
- Requirement (future phases): Display a scrollable list of ~6 placeholder "league cards" with structure:
  - Image placeholder
  - Top-right tag (e.g., Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
  - Header (league name)
  - Subtext (short description)
  - Bottom left: user count with "Users" icon + number (use 55)
  - Bottom right: "Trending" with line graph icon
  - Not clickable yet
  - Scrollable list layout

Do (Spike Scope):
- Investigate routing integration for /leagues (confirm where routes are defined, and how placeholders can be injected).
- Identify best file structure for LeaguesPage.tsx and LeagueCard.tsx components.
- Review existing UI patterns (e.g., card styles, shadows, spacing) to determine reuse vs new styles.
- Verify lucide-react icons available:
  - Users (3-people icon)
  - LineChart (for Trending)
- Recommend best approach for scrollable list layout (flexbox vs CSS grid vs overflow-y).
- Draft a phased implementation plan for building the feature in follow-up work.

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If routing integration is unclear or auth gating blocks rendering → STOP, summarize findings, wait for operator approval
- If icons missing from lucide-react → STOP and recommend alternatives

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work drifts toward creating a working UI prototype, new API endpoints, or schema changes → STOP and summarize deviation
- This spike is only for analysis and planning

Expected Deliverables:
- Documentation of:
  - Where the /leagues route should live
  - Recommended file/component structure
  - Feasible styling/layout approaches
  - Available icons verification
- A phased implementation plan, e.g.:
  - Phase 1: Build static LeagueCard component
  - Phase 2: Render 6 placeholder cards in LeaguesPage
  - Phase 3: Add scrollable container & responsive polish
  - Phase 4: Validation & test plan
