Goal: Implement Phase 4 of leagues_active.md (frontend Active tab enhancement for league completion)

Do:
- Update the Active tab in `LeaguesPage`:
  - Query joined leagues with: GET /api/leagues filtered by `userMembership.isActive = true`
  - Render joined leagues in list view
- Update `LeagueCard` component:
  - Add support for new `completionMode?: boolean` prop for Active tab rendering
  - In completionMode:
    - If league `completed_at` is NULL → show “Mark Completed” CTA (orange button, one-click)
    - If league `completed_at` has a timestamp → show “Completed ✓” badge (green, disabled)
- CTA behavior:
  - One-click → triggers POST /api/leagues/:id/memberships with `{ action: "complete" }`
  - Disable CTA after completion
- Style:
  - Use existing Strava-style theme (#FF5A1F orange, #28A745 green)
  - Badge state should match current “Joined” CTA styling
- Gating:
  - Wrap entire Active tab completion UI behind `ff.potato.leagues.active`
  - If flag OFF → keep placeholder text (“Your joined leagues will appear here”)
- Restart frontend with:
    restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")

Proof:
- With flag ON:
  - Active tab lists joined leagues (userMembership.isActive = true)
  - CTA displays “Mark Completed” → clicking sets badge “Completed ✓” (disabled)
  - State persists after reload
- With flag OFF:
  - Active tab shows placeholder only
- API and SQL checks confirm completed_at is set for completed leagues:

    SELECT user_id, league_id, is_active, completed_at
    FROM league_memberships
    WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:
    restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-like check:
    restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If CTA click fails (API/network), ensure error is surfaced (toast/log) but CTA not marked as completed
- If frontend crashes due to missing data fields:
  → STOP immediately
  → Summarize issue and recommend fix
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If investigation suggests new UI components (e.g., a dedicated Completed tab) beyond requirements:
  → STOP immediately
  → Summarize deviation vs. phase plan (docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_active.md)
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming
