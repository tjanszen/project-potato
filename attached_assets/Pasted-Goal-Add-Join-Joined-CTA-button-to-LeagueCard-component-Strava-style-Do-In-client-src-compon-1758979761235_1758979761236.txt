Goal: Add Join/Joined CTA button to LeagueCard component (Strava-style)

Do:
- In `client/src/components/LeagueCard.tsx`:
  - Add a bottom-anchored CTA button inside each card.
  - States:
    - **Join**: orange background (#FF5A1F or use theme primary), bold white text, label "Join"
    - **Joined**: green background (#28A745 or use theme success), bold white text, label "Joined"
  - Full-width across the card bottom with slight padding/margin above.
  - Rounded corners to match the card’s radius.
  - Fixed height (e.g. 40–48px) for visual consistency across cards.
- Behavior:
  - Use `userMembership` prop:
    - If `isActive=true` → show "Joined" (green, triggers leaveLeague on click)
    - Else → show "Join" (orange, triggers joinLeague on click)
  - Hook up to React Query mutations (from Phase 3A API client).
  - After mutation, refetch membership + counts to keep state consistent.
- Ensure accessibility: role="button", keyboard focusable, aria-labels for screen readers.

Proof:
- Logs must include: "LeagueCard CTA rendered"
- Visual check: Each LeagueCard shows Join/Joined button at bottom
- Interaction test:
  - Clicking Join → membership created, button flips to Joined
  - Clicking Joined → membership deactivated, button flips to Join
- API check: network requests observed for `/api/leagues/:id/memberships` POST and DELETE
- State check: memberCount updates correctly after join/leave

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  `restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")`  
  → Ensure frontend compiles after card changes
- For production-style verification:  
  `restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")`  
  → Confirm CTA buttons visible + interactive in live preview

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (buttons not clickable, API errors, React Query not updating):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates (e.g. redesigns full card layout, modifies unrelated pages):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  → Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  → WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming
