# 📋 Daily Postbrief — 2025-09-10

## ✅ What Happened
Today was a deep-dive investigation into the September 8th "500 Internal Server Error when marking days."  
We tested multiple hypotheses about server stability, schema integrity, and Replit environment behavior.  
We also updated core documentation (Bug Journal, Playbooks, Patch Plan) to lock in accurate root causes and prevent future rediscovery of the same issues.

## 🔍 Key Investigation Steps & Results

### 1. Initial Reproduction Attempt
- Tried marking a day (`/api/days/2025-09-08/no-drink`) as test user.  
- Observed connection refused errors — could not connect to server.  

### 2. Database Schema Check
- Confirmed `day_marks` table **exists**.  
- Found **mismatch**: table has `date` column, but Drizzle expects `local_date`.  
- ✅ Verified data rows present.  
- ❌ Confirmed this mismatch will cause 500 errors when marking days.

### 3. Server Startup Analysis
- Ran with `DEBUG=* node index.js`.  
- ✅ Server initializes cleanly: feature flags, storage, schema, totals all load.  
- ✅ Express logs show "Server listening on port 3000."  
- ❌ Curl to localhost/127.0.0.1 returned connection refused.  

### 4. Networking & Port Binding Tests
- Bound to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` with fallback to 3000.  
- ✅ Internal curl worked when process run in foreground.  
- ❌ External curl via `$REPLIT_DOMAINS` returned 502 Bad Gateway.  
- `.replit` correctly mapped ports (`localPort=3000 → externalPort=80`).  

### 5. Background Process Persistence
- Tried `nohup node index.js &`, `PORT=3000 node index.js &`, `timeout 15 node index.js &`.  
- ❌ Each process was immediately killed by Replit environment.  
- Logs vanished, no persistent process remained.

## 🎯 Final Conclusions
- ❌ Original diagnosis (“missing day_marks table”) was incorrect.  
- ❌ Secondary diagnosis (“server crash after startup”) was incorrect.  
- ✅ Correct diagnosis:  
  - **Root cause** = Replit environment limitation.  
    - Background processes cannot persist.  
    - Replit proxy cannot reach server unless managed by Replit Run/Deploy/Workflows.  
  - **Additional issue** = Schema mismatch (`date` vs `local_date`) must be fixed.  
- ✅ Application code is otherwise correct: server, flags, schema loading, and totals all work.

---

## 📚 Documentation Work Completed
- **Bug Journal** → Sept 8 entry corrected (root cause = environment misconfiguration).  
- **Playbooks** → Added “Replit Server Persistence” section (run via Workflows/Deploy, never background).  
- **Patch Plan (v2.md)** → Updated “Schema Fix & Validation” plan to reflect column rename (`date → local_date`) instead of missing tables.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Apply schema patch: `ALTER TABLE day_marks RENAME COLUMN date TO local_date;`.  
2. Validate end-to-end: API call returns 200, DB row written with `local_date`.  
3. Close out remaining validation tasks.

## ✅ Status
- Server code: Correct.  
- Environment: Limiting factor.  
- Bug Journal: Updated.  
- Playbooks: Updated.  
- Patch Plan: Updated.  
- Schema fix: Pending.
