Goal: Fix Phase 2 of stat card redesign — properly restructure card layout to match wireframe under FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2.

Context:
- Implementation plan: docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/stat_card_update.md
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2 (already exists and validated)
- Phase 1 complete: icons imported and test-rendered
- Current Phase 2 attempt only placed icons next to "days" text, did not restructure layout

Do:
- In client/src/components/TotalsPanel.tsx (within shouldRemoveHeader branch):
  - Move stat label text ("Current Run", "Longest Run", "Total Days") to the top of each card
  - Render the **number below the label**
  - Render the **icon inline to the right of the number** using horizontal flexbox
  - Remove the **“days” text completely**
  - Ensure consistent styling (icons sized appropriately, aligned with number)
- Preserve backward compatibility:
  - Flag=false → Original UI unchanged
  - Flag=true → New layout with label on top, number+icon inline, no “days”

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:  
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")
- Never use individual frontend-only restarts

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (layout breaks, >3 TS errors, repeated crashes, unmet prerequisites):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  → WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates from agreed scope (adding new designs, refactors, schema changes):
  → STOP immediately  
  → Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  → Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  → WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming  

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=false → Original UI (number → label → days)
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=true:
  - Label shown at top of card
  - Number displayed below the label
  - Icon aligned horizontally to the right of the number
  - “days” text removed completely
- Browser visually matches wireframe mock (header → number+icon layout)
