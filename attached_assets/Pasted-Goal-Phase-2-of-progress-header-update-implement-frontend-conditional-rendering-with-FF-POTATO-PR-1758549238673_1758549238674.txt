Goal: Phase 2 of progress header update â€” implement frontend conditional rendering with FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2.

Context:
- Implementation plan: docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/progress_header_v2.md
- Feature flag name: FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2
- Phase 1 complete: backend plumbing, API + admin toggle tested and verified

Do:
- In client/src/components/TotalsPanel.tsx:
  - Import/use feature flag hook to check ff.potato.progress_header_v2
  - Wrap the "ðŸ“Š Your Progress" header (lines 168-175) in conditional rendering â†’ hidden when flag=true
  - Wrap the container <div> styling (lines 161-167) in conditional rendering â†’ removed when flag=true
  - Wrap the explanatory text block (lines 275-288) in conditional rendering â†’ removed when flag=true
  - When flag=true, render only the stats grid (3 stat boxes) with no header/container/explanatory text
- No spacing changes yet (those come in Phase 3)

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:  
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")  
  â†’ Use this for all testing scenarios after code modifications
- For production-style verification:  
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")  
  â†’ Use when validating final changes in a built frontend environment
- Never use individual frontend-only restarts (causes "Failed to fetch" errors)

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If critical issues occur (missing endpoints, >3 TS errors, repeated crashes, unmet prerequisites, infra failures):
  â†’ STOP immediately  
  â†’ Summarize findings + recommend next steps  
  â†’ WAIT for operator approval before resuming  

Scope Control (Deviation Protocol):
- If work deviates from agreed scope (new endpoints, schema changes, unplanned refactors, added features):
  â†’ STOP immediately  
  â†’ Summarize deviation vs. agreed scope  
  â†’ Provide pros/cons of addressing now vs. deferring  
  â†’ WAIT for explicit operator approval before resuming  

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=false â†’ UI remains unchanged (header + container + explanatory text all visible)
- With FF_POTATO_PROGRESS_HEADER_V2=true â†’ UI shows only 3 stat boxes grid, no header, no container, no explanatory text
- Logs show flag query and correct conditional render path
