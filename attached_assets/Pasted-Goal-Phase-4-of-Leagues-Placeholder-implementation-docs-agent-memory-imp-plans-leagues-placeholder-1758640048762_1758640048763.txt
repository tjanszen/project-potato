Goal: Phase 4 of Leagues Placeholder implementation (docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_placeholder.md)

Context:
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER (default=false, controls LeaguesPage rendering)
- Phase 2 delivered: /leagues route with 6 hardcoded inline placeholder cards
- Phase 2.5 delivered: BottomNav integration → Leagues button now navigates to /leagues
- Phase 3 delivered: LeagueCard.tsx refactor with props for tag, title, description, users, trending
- Requirement: Add responsive layout polish and scroll improvements to match mobile-first wireframe

Do:
- Update LeaguesPage.tsx and/or LeagueCard.css to improve responsiveness:
  - Mobile (≤480px): 1 card per row
  - Tablet (481–768px): 2 cards per row
  - Desktop (>768px): 3 cards per row
- Ensure scrollable container works across all viewports:
  - Container: overflow-y: auto
  - Respect BottomNav spacing by reusing CSS variable or padding-bottom (70px)
- Validate smooth scrolling on mobile devices
- Ensure touch-friendly spacing (min 44px tap targets preserved)
- Accessibility improvements:
  - Add role="list" to card container
  - Ensure LeagueCard keeps role="listitem"
- Visual polish:
  - Maintain consistent margins, rounded corners, and shadows
  - Ensure tags and icons scale well across breakpoints

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If responsive breakpoints don’t apply as expected → STOP, summarize findings
- If BottomNav overlaps cards → STOP, summarize fix options before proceeding

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=false → /leagues renders nothing
- With FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=true:
  - /leagues shows 6 LeagueCard components in scrollable container
  - On mobile viewport (≤480px): 1 card per row
  - On tablet viewport (481–768px): 2 cards per row
  - On desktop viewport (>768px): 3 cards per row
  - Scrolling works smoothly, no overlap with BottomNav
  - Console log: "Phase 4: Responsive polish active"
