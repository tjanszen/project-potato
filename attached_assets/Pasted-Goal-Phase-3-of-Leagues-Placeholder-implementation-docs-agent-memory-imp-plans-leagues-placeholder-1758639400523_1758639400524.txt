Goal: Phase 3 of Leagues Placeholder implementation (docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_placeholder.md)

Context:
- Feature flag: FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER (default=false, controls LeaguesPage rendering)
- Phase 2 delivered: /leagues route with 6 hardcoded inline placeholder cards
- Phase 2.5 delivered: BottomNav Leagues button now navigates to /leagues
- Requirement: Refactor inline card markup into a reusable LeagueCard component to reduce duplication and improve maintainability

Do:
- Create new component: client/src/components/LeagueCard.tsx
  - Props: 
    - tag (string)
    - title (string)
    - description (string)
    - users (number)
    - trending (boolean)
  - Structure:
    - Gray rectangle image placeholder
    - Top-right tag label
    - Title (header)
    - Description (subtext)
    - Bottom row:
      - Left: Users icon + users count
      - Right: LineChart icon + "Trending" (only if trending=true)
  - Accessibility: role="listitem", cursor: default
- Update LeaguesPage.tsx:
  - Replace inline markup with mapped array of league objects passed into <LeagueCard />
  - Example object: { tag: "Beginner", title: "Weekend Warrior", description: "Casual weekend running league", users: 55, trending: true }
- Keep scrollable container layout and styling as-is
- Ensure feature flag gating remains at the LeaguesPage level

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")

Error Handling (Mid-Phase Protocol):
- If LeagueCard props integration fails → STOP and summarize findings
- If styling diverges from Phase 2 output → STOP and summarize differences

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=false → /leagues renders nothing
- With FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=true:
  - Visiting /leagues shows 6 placeholder cards rendered via LeagueCard component
  - Cards match Phase 2 layout (no regressions)
  - Console logs confirm LeagueCard component mounted for each card
- Active state in BottomNav highlights Leagues when on /leagues
