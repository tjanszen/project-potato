Goal: Phase 3 of Leagues Tabs implementation — integrate content into each tab.

Context:
- Implementation plan documented in docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_tabs.md
- Phase 2 complete: TabBar UI added with Active, List, Clubs tabs (local state switching, styled for mobile web)
- Feature flags:
  - FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=true → enables /leagues page
  - FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_TABS=true → enables tabbed layout
- Current state: Tab switching works, but no tab content is rendered

Do:
- In client/src/pages/LeaguesPage.tsx:
  - Create a TabContent component (inline or sub-component in same file)
  - When activeTab === "list":
    - Render the existing LeagueCard grid (from Phase 2 implementation of FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER)
  - When activeTab === "active":
    - Render placeholder content: <div>Active leagues placeholder</div>
  - When activeTab === "clubs":
    - Render placeholder content: <div>Clubs placeholder</div>
- Ensure LeagueCard grid is unchanged in design and behavior when inside the List tab
- Adjust container height so scrollable content works properly with tab bar and BottomNav
- Add console logging:
  - “Phase 3: Rendering [tab] content”

Workflows to Use:
- Always run:
  restart_workflow("Full Clean Restart")
- For production-style verification:
  restart_workflow("Clean Production Deploy")

Error Handling:
- If grid does not render inside List tab or placeholders do not appear, STOP and summarize findings
- If flags misbehave, STOP and log current flag states

Prompt Template Instruction (New Rule):
- Do NOT use mark_completed_and_get_feedback — this tool is unreliable and undocumented
- Instead, validate success with:
  - curl /api/feature-flags → confirm both FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER and FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_TABS enabled
  - Browser test → Tab switching updates visible content
  - Console logs → “Phase 3: Rendering [tab] content” appears when switching tabs

Proof:
- With FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_PLACEHOLDER=true and FF_POTATO_LEAGUES_TABS=false:
  - Page shows current LeagueCard grid with no TabBar
- With both flags true:
  - TabBar visible
  - Active tab → shows “Active leagues placeholder”
  - List tab → shows 6 placeholder LeagueCards in scrollable grid
  - Clubs tab → shows “Clubs placeholder”
  - Console logs confirm active tab content rendering
