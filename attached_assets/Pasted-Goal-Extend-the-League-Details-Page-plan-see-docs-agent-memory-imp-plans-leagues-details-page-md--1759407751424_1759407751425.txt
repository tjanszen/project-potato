Goal: Extend the League Details Page plan (see docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/leagues_details_page.md) with additional phases. This is **planning only** — no code should be written yet.

Context:
- The current plan covered Phases 1–5:
  - Phase 1: Backend members API
  - Phase 2: LeagueDetailsPage component + route
  - Phase 3: Navigation from Active tab cards
  - Phase 4: Completion CTA on details page
  - Phase 5: End-to-end validation (✅ completed)
- Now we need to add new functionality for users who are not yet members, and improve navigation with a back arrow.

New Requirements:
1. **Non-member access to details page**
   - Users who are not members should still be able to open a league’s details page.
   - They should see all the same information: league header, description, and member list.
   - Instead of “Mark Completed” / “Completed” CTA, they should see a **“Join” CTA**.
   - Once they join, the CTA should switch to “Mark Completed” (existing logic applies).
2. **Back arrow navigation**
   - A back arrow should appear in the top-left corner of the League Details page.
   - If the user entered from the Active tab → pressing back should return to Active tab.
   - If the user entered from the List tab → pressing back should return to List tab.
   - For MVP, simple back navigation is sufficient (no deep-linking/sharing required).

Do:
- Extend the implementation plan with new **Phase 6 and beyond** to address these requirements.
- For each new phase, provide:
  - Goal
  - Scope of changes (frontend/backend/flag handling as needed)
  - Verification steps (logs, SQL, API, frontend proof)
  - Rollback strategy (via feature flag)
- Follow the same structured style used for Phases 1–5.
- Deliver output as a markdown outline with only the new phases.

Proof:
- Addendum must clearly list **Phase 6+ only** (do not rewrite Phases 1–5).
- Each phase must include clear verification steps.
- Confirm that no code has been written — planning deliverable only.

Scope Control:
- STOP if new requirements would force schema changes or new backend endpoints (not expected).
- WAIT for operator approval before suggesting backend extensions.
