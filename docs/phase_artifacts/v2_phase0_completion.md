### ✅ Algorithm handles timezone-aware consecutive day detection
**Evidence:** Algorithm design in `v2_phase0_research.md` Section 5
- User timezone preference utilized from `users.timezone` field
- Local date calculations respect user timezone boundaries
- Daylight saving time and international date line handled
- Pseudocode includes timezone parameter in all date operations

### ✅ Performance benchmarks established for calculation overhead
**Evidence:** Performance analysis in `v2_phase0_research.md` Section 8
- **Target:** <50ms run calculation per day marking
- **API Response:** <500ms total including run calculation
- **Database Queries:** <10ms per indexed lookup
- **Algorithm Complexity:** O(log n) for run detection operations
