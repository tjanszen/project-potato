# Phase 0 Research: V2 Runs & Totals Tracking

**Goal:** Research and define business rules for runs calculation, validate data model tradeoffs, and establish calculation algorithms before database changes.

**Feature Flag:** `ff.potato.runs_v2` (default OFF)

---

## 1. Run Calculation Rules Definition

### Core Business Rules

**Run Definition:** A "run" is a sequence of consecutive calendar days where a user has marked "No Drink".

**Consecutive Day Logic:**
- Days are consecutive if they are calendar-adjacent (Day N and Day N+1)
- No gaps allowed within a single run
- Timezone-aware: "consecutive" is determined by the user's configured timezone
- Cross-month boundaries are valid (e.g., January 31 → February 1)
- Cross-year boundaries are valid (e.g., December 31 → January 1)

**Timezone Boundary Handling:**
- Use user's stored timezone preference from `users.timezone` field
- Calculate "today" and consecutive dates in user's timezone
- Day transitions occur at midnight in user's timezone, not UTC
- Example: User in "America/New_York" timezone - day boundaries at EST/EDT midnight

**Gap Handling Rules:**
- **Gap Definition:** One or more unmarked days between marked days
- **Gap Filling:** When user marks a day that creates consecutive sequence, merge separate runs
- **No Retroactive Runs:** Unmarked days do not automatically become runs
- **Gap Size Irrelevant:** 1-day gap vs 30-day gap treated equally for merging logic

### Edge Cases

**Month Boundaries:**
- January 31 + February 1 = consecutive (28/29/30/31 day months handled)
- February 28 + March 1 = consecutive (leap year aware)
- Leap year detection: February 29 is valid consecutive day in leap years

**Timezone Edge Cases:**
- User changes timezone mid-run: use timezone at time of each day marking
- Daylight Saving Time transitions: 23-hour and 25-hour days still consecutive
- International Date Line: handled by timezone-aware date calculations

**Data Integrity:**
- Cannot mark future dates beyond "today" in user's timezone
- Cannot mark dates before January 1, 2025 (application start date)
- Duplicate day marking is idempotent (no-op, maintains existing run)

---

## 2. Data Model Research & Analysis

### Option A: Users Table Columns

**Schema Addition:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN current_run_start_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN current_run_day_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN longest_run_day_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN total_days_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Pros:**
- Simple queries: `SELECT current_run_day_count FROM users WHERE id = ?`
- No additional JOINs required for dashboard display
- Atomic updates with day marking in single transaction
- Minimal storage overhead (4 columns per user)

**Cons:**
- No historical run data (only current run + longest)
- Cannot reconstruct past runs for analytics
- Limited scalability for future features (run history, run sharing)
- Denormalized data requires careful update logic
- No audit trail of run changes

### Option B: Dedicated Runs Table (RECOMMENDED)

**Schema Design:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL,
  day_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_runs_user_id ON runs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_runs_active ON runs(user_id, active);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_runs_user_active ON runs(user_id) WHERE active = true;
```

**Pros:**
- Complete historical run data preserved
- Scalable for future features (run analytics, sharing, comparisons)
- Normalized data model with clear relationships
- Supports multiple runs per user over time
- `active` flag enables easy current run queries
- Audit trail of all run changes via timestamps

**Cons:**
- Requires JOINs for dashboard queries
- Slightly more complex update logic
- Additional storage overhead (~40 bytes per run)
- Need to maintain `active` flag consistency

### Performance Analysis

**Query Patterns:**
- Dashboard stats: `SELECT COUNT(*) as total_days, day_count as current_run FROM runs WHERE user_id = ? AND active = true`
- Longest run: `SELECT MAX(day_count) FROM runs WHERE user_id = ?`
- Run history: `SELECT * FROM runs WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY start_date DESC LIMIT 20`

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Users table queries: ~1ms (single row lookup)
- Runs table queries: ~2-5ms (indexed user_id lookup + aggregation)
- Both options meet <500ms response time requirement
- Dedicated table scales better with 100+ runs per user

### Decision: Dedicated Runs Table

**Rationale:** Future scalability, data integrity, and feature extensibility outweigh slight performance cost. The 2-5ms query time is acceptable for <500ms API response requirement.

## 3. Test Scenarios & Edge Cases

### Basic Run Operations

**Test Case 1: Single Day Run**
- Input: User marks 2025-06-15
- Expected: Create run (start=2025-06-15, end=2025-06-15, day_count=1, active=true)
- Verification: `SELECT * FROM runs WHERE user_id = ? AND active = true`

**Test Case 2: Consecutive Day Extension**
- Setup: Existing run (2025-06-15 to 2025-06-15, day_count=1)
- Input: User marks 2025-06-16
- Expected: Update run (start=2025-06-15, end=2025-06-16, day_count=2, active=true)
- Verification: Only one active run exists with correct dates

**Test Case 3: Gap Filling & Run Merging**
- Setup: Two runs (2025-06-15 to 2025-06-15, day_count=1) and (2025-06-17 to 2025-06-17, day_count=1)
- Input: User marks 2025-06-16
- Expected: Merge to single run (start=2025-06-15, end=2025-06-17, day_count=3, active=true)
- Verification: Only one active run, two previous runs marked active=false

### Month Boundary Cases

**Test Case 4: Cross Month Boundary**
- Input: User marks 2025-06-30, then 2025-07-01
- Expected: Single run (start=2025-06-30, end=2025-07-01, day_count=2, active=true)
- Verification: Month transition handled correctly

**Test Case 5: Leap Year February**
- Input: User marks 2024-02-28, 2024-02-29, 2024-03-01 (if in leap year)
- Expected: Single run across leap day boundary
- Verification: February 29 recognized as valid consecutive day

### Timezone Edge Cases

**Test Case 6: Timezone-Aware Consecutive Detection**
- Setup: User timezone = "America/New_York" (UTC-5/UTC-4)
- Input: Mark day at 11:00 PM EST, then next day at 1:00 AM EST
- Expected: Consecutive days in user timezone despite UTC date overlap
- Verification: Consecutive logic uses user timezone, not UTC

**Test Case 7: Multiple Time Zones**
- Setup: Two users in different timezones mark same UTC timestamp
- Expected: Different local dates based on user timezone
- Verification: Timezone-specific date calculation

### Error Cases

**Test Case 8: Future Date Rejection**
- Input: User attempts to mark tomorrow's date
- Expected: Validation error, no run created
- Verification: Date must be <= "today" in user timezone

**Test Case 9: Idempotent Day Marking**
- Setup: Existing run includes 2025-06-15
- Input: User marks 2025-06-15 again
- Expected: No change to existing run (idempotent operation)
- Verification: Run data unchanged, no duplicate entries

## 4. Run Merging Logic Validation

### Merging Algorithm

**Scenario: Fill Single Day Gap**
```
Before: Run A (June 15-15, count=1), Run B (June 17-17, count=1)
Action: Mark June 16
After: Run C (June 15-17, count=3, active=true)
       Run A (active=false), Run B (active=false)
```

**Merging Steps:**
1. Identify adjacent runs (runs that become consecutive with new day)
2. Calculate new run boundaries (min start_date, max end_date)
3. Calculate new day count (actual consecutive days)
4. Create new merged run with active=true
5. Mark old runs as active=false (preserve history)
6. Update within single database transaction

**Complex Merging: Fill Multi-Day Gap**
```
Before: Run A (June 10-12, count=3), Run B (June 20-22, count=3)
Action: Mark June 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 (7 days)
After: Run C (June 10-22, count=13, active=true)
       Run A (active=false), Run B (active=false)
```

### Validation Rules

**Pre-Merge Validation:**
- Verify new day creates consecutive sequence
- Check maximum merged run size (reasonable limit: 365 days)
- Ensure no active run conflicts

**Post-Merge Validation:**
- Exactly one active run per user
- Day count matches actual date range
- Start date ≤ end date
- No overlapping runs for same user

## 5. Run Calculation Algorithm Design

### Algorithm Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION calculateRunUpdate(userId, newDate, userTimezone):
  // Validate input date
  IF newDate > getCurrentDate(userTimezone):
    THROW "Cannot mark future dates"
  
  IF newDate < "2025-01-01":
    THROW "Cannot mark dates before app launch"
  
  // Check if date already marked (idempotent)
  IF dayMarkExists(userId, newDate):
    RETURN "No change - day already marked"
  
  BEGIN TRANSACTION:
    // Create day mark
    INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES (userId, newDate, true)
    
    // Find adjacent runs
    previousRun = findRunEndingOn(userId, newDate - 1 day)
    nextRun = findRunStartingOn(userId, newDate + 1 day)
    
    IF previousRun AND nextRun:
      // Merge three segments: [previousRun] + [newDate] + [nextRun]
      createMergedRun(userId, previousRun.start_date, nextRun.end_date, 
                     calculateDayCount(previousRun.start_date, nextRun.end_date))
      deactivateRun(previousRun.id)
      deactivateRun(nextRun.id)
    
    ELSE IF previousRun:
      // Extend previous run forward
      updateRun(previousRun.id, end_date=newDate, day_count=previousRun.day_count + 1)
    
    ELSE IF nextRun:
      // Extend next run backward
      updateRun(nextRun.id, start_date=newDate, day_count=nextRun.day_count + 1)
    
    ELSE:
      // Create new single-day run
      createRun(userId, start_date=newDate, end_date=newDate, day_count=1, active=true)
  
  COMMIT TRANSACTION
  
  RETURN runUpdateResult
```

### Performance Considerations

**Query Optimization:**
- Index on `(user_id, active)` for current run lookups
- Index on `(user_id, start_date, end_date)` for adjacent run detection
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Batch operations within transactions

**Algorithm Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: O(log n) for indexed run lookups
- Space Complexity: O(1) for single run operations
- Database Operations: 2-4 queries per day marking (acceptable)

**Performance Targets:**
- Run calculation: <50ms per day marking
- API response time: <500ms total (including run calculation)
- Memory usage: <1MB per calculation
- Database connections: Reuse existing connection pool

## 6. Run Lifecycle Documentation

### Lifecycle States & Transitions

```
[No Runs] --mark day--> [Single Day Run]
                           |
                     mark adjacent day
                           ↓
[Extended Run] <--mark adjacent day-- [Multi-Day Run]
     |                                      |
     |--mark gap day--> [Merged Run] <------|
                           |
                    mark non-adjacent day
                           ↓
              [Multiple Active Runs] --mark gap--> [Merged Runs]
```

### State Definitions

**No Runs State:**
- User has no active runs (active=false for all runs or no runs exist)
- Total days counted from all historical runs
- Next day marking creates new single-day run

**Single Day Run:**
- One active run with start_date = end_date, day_count = 1
- Can extend forward/backward or merge with gap filling
- Represents starting point for consecutive sequences

**Multi-Day Run:**
- One active run with day_count > 1
- Continuous sequence of marked days
- Can extend in either direction or merge with gap filling

**Multiple Active Runs (Temporary):**
- Should never exist due to unique constraint on (user_id, active=true)
- If occurs, indicates bug in merging logic
- System should auto-resolve to single active run

### Transition Operations

**Run Creation (No Runs → Single Day):**
1. Validate new date
2. Create day_mark record
3. Create new run (start=end=newDate, day_count=1, active=true)
4. Update user statistics cache

**Run Extension (Single/Multi-Day → Extended):**
1. Validate adjacent date
2. Create day_mark record
3. Update existing run (extend start_date or end_date, increment day_count)
4. Update user statistics cache

**Run Merging (Multiple Runs → Single Merged):**
1. Validate gap-filling date
2. Create day_mark record
3. Calculate merged run boundaries
4. Create new merged run (active=true)
5. Deactivate old runs (active=false, preserve history)
6. Update user statistics cache

## 7. Sample Test Data for Validation

### Test User Setup

```sql
-- Test user with timezone
INSERT INTO users (id, email, password_hash, timezone, created_at) 
VALUES ('test-user-1', 'test@runs.com', 'hashed_password', 'America/New_York', NOW());
```

### Test Scenario Data

**Scenario 1: Basic Run Progression**
```sql
-- Day 1: Single day run
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-15', true);
INSERT INTO runs (user_id, start_date, end_date, day_count, active) 
VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-15', '2025-06-15', 1, true);

-- Day 2: Extend run
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-16', true);
UPDATE runs SET end_date = '2025-06-16', day_count = 2 WHERE user_id = 'test-user-1' AND active = true;

-- Day 3: Skip day, create new run
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-18', true);
UPDATE runs SET active = false WHERE user_id = 'test-user-1' AND active = true;
INSERT INTO runs (user_id, start_date, end_date, day_count, active) 
VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-18', '2025-06-18', 1, true);

-- Day 4: Fill gap, merge runs
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-17', true);
-- Merging logic would create: start='2025-06-15', end='2025-06-18', day_count=4
```

**Scenario 2: Month Boundary Test**
```sql
-- June 30 to July 1 transition
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-06-30', true);
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-07-01', true);
-- Expected: Single run across month boundary
```

**Scenario 3: Complex Merging**
```sql
-- Multiple runs that merge into long sequence
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-08-01', true);  -- Run A
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-08-03', true);  -- Run B  
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-08-05', true);  -- Run C
INSERT INTO day_marks (user_id, date, value) VALUES ('test-user-1', '2025-08-07', true);  -- Run D

-- Fill gaps: 08-02, 08-04, 08-06
-- Expected: Single run from 08-01 to 08-07, day_count=7
```

### Validation Queries

```sql
-- Verify single active run per user
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as active_run_count 
FROM runs 
WHERE active = true 
GROUP BY user_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;  -- Should return no rows

-- Verify day count accuracy
SELECT user_id, start_date, end_date, day_count,
       (end_date - start_date + 1) as calculated_count
FROM runs 
WHERE active = true 
AND day_count != (end_date - start_date + 1);  -- Should return no rows

-- Verify total days calculation
SELECT r.user_id, 
       SUM(r.day_count) as total_run_days,
       COUNT(dm.date) as total_marked_days
FROM runs r
JOIN day_marks dm ON r.user_id = dm.user_id
WHERE dm.value = true
GROUP BY r.user_id
HAVING SUM(r.day_count) != COUNT(dm.date);  -- Should return no rows
```
