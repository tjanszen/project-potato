# Daily Postbrief: 2025-09-12

## Session Overview
**Focus**: Phase 6B-1 completion (extend + merge), bug diagnosis, Preview environment validation, and stability improvements.  
**Duration**: Full-day investigation and implementation.  
**Status**: ✅ Major gaps closed; extend + merge now integrated and functional.

---

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Phase 6B-1a Extend & Merge Implementation
- **perform_run_extend**:
  - ✅ Fully implemented and integrated into `markDay()`
  - Handles forward/backward extension, idempotency, and non-consecutive runs
- **perform_run_merge**:
  - ✅ Implemented SQL logic with transaction safety and idempotency
  - ✅ Fixed critical integration bug — function was never called in `markDay()`
  - ✅ Now wired correctly before `perform_run_extend`
  - ✅ Debug logging added for clarity
- **Result**: Runs now extend and merge automatically in real time, fixing long-standing UI bugs.

### 2. Critical Bug Discovery & Resolution
- **Reported Bug**: Gap-fill scenario (9/9 → 9/10 → 9/12 → 9/11) produced day_count=3 instead of 4
- **Investigation**:
  - SQL audit confirmed `perform_run_merge` function was correct (day_count=4)
  - Root cause: `markDay()` never invoked merge in Preview environment
- **Fix**:
  - Integrated merge before extend in `markDay()`
  - Re-tested in Preview with debug logs
  - ✅ Final result: Correct merged run [2025-09-09, 2025-09-13) with day_count=4

### 3. Feature Flag Verification
- Confirmed `ff.potato.runs_v2` was ON during testing
- Integration issue, not flag configuration, caused the discrepancy
- ✅ Feature flag system confirmed stable and effective for rollout control

### 4. Proof & Validation
- SQL validation confirmed correct behavior for extend + merge
- UI validation in Preview matched expected totals:
  - **Current Run** updated correctly
  - **Longest Run** preserved accurately
  - **Total Days** consistent with day_marks
- Debug logs provide clear traceability of merge → extend sequence

## Technical Lessons Learned

### Integration Matters More Than SQL Alone
- SQL functions can be correct, but missing or misordered integration breaks UI results
- Always validate **end-to-end**: DB → storage.js → API → UI

### Debug Logging is Critical
- Adding explicit `[DEBUG]` logs for merge and extend helped pinpoint ordering issues immediately
- Logging will remain part of `markDay()` to catch regressions early

### Preview vs Production Discrepancies
- Bug was only visible in `.dev/Preview` because merge was not wired there yet
- Confirms need for environment-specific audits before rollout

## Documentation Updates
- **bugs_journal.md**: New entry — gap-fill bug (merge missing in Preview) diagnosed and fixed
- **imp_plans/6b1_completion.md**: Updated status — extend + merge complete, split pending
- **writing_rules.md**: Expanded with Server Persistence rules; all prompts must now include Error Handling, Scope Control, and Server Persistence

---

## Current Status
- ✅ Extend integrated  
- ✅ Merge integrated  
- ⏳ Split pending (not implemented or wired)  
- ✅ Preview validation passed  
- ✅ Feature flag stable  
- ✅ UI bug fixed in `.dev/Preview`

---

## Next Steps
1. **System-wide Validation Sweep** (6B-1c-lite): Confirm extend + merge invariants across all users (no overlaps, correct day_count, one active run max).
2. **Documentation & Closure**: Record bug fix + partial completion of 6B-1 in ADR and postbriefs.
3. **Hold Split Until Needed**: Defer `perform_run_split` until unmarking/removal features are in scope.
4. **Advance Phase 7**: With stable extend + merge, unblock dashboard/totals-related features.

## Status Summary
- ✅ Major UI bug resolved (gap-fill day_count incorrect)  
- ✅ Extend + merge now production-ready  
- ✅ Preview shows correct behavior end-to-end  
- ⚠️ Split still pending  
- ⏳ Next focus: invariant validation + Phase 7 features
