# Daily Pre-Brief - 2025-09-01

## Today's Objectives
- [ ] Fix deployment configuration bug (missing start script, server binding)
- [ ] Set up Custom GPT with proper raw GitHub file access
- [ ] Complete Phase 0 properly with working deployment
- [ ] Request approval for Phase 1 (Authentication System)

## Context from Yesterday
- GitHub backup successfully configured
- Custom GPT integration working (but needs raw file access fix)
- Phase 0 foundation complete (database, feature flags, server)
- Bug discovered: deployment configuration missing start script

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Deployment bug must be fixed before Phase 1 approval
- Custom GPT needs raw GitHub URL configuration to read bugs_journal.md properly

## Phase Status
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation & Database Setup)
**Progress:** 95% complete - deployment bug blocking final closure
**Next Milestone:** Fix deployment issue, then request Phase 1 approval

## Notes
- Daily brief workflow now established for better project tracking
- Agent memory system operational with comprehensive documentation
- Feature flag system (ff.potato.no_drink_v1) ready for phased rollout
