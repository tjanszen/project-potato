# Daily Pre-Brief - 2025-09-01

## Today's Objectives
- [x] **Pilot agent memory setup** - learn how the workflow/process works ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Connect project to GitHub** - learn how to sync commits ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] **Update Custom GPT** - read GitHub repo, educate itself on project status ✅ COMPLETED (needs raw URL fix)
- [ ] **Custom GPT review** - have GPT review implementation plan and provide POV ❌ NOT COMPLETED
- [x] **Deploy to production** - fix deployment issues discovered in bugs_journal ✅ COMPLETED

## Context from Yesterday
- Phase 0 foundation work complete (database, feature flags, Express server)
- Agent memory documentation system fully established
- Feature flag system (ff.potato.no_drink_v1) operational
- Ready to test deployment and get external perspective on implementation

## Blockers/Dependencies
- Deployment bugs blocking production deploy (documented in bugs_journal.md)
- Custom GPT needs raw GitHub URL fix to properly read all documentation
- Learning curve: figuring out optimal workflow for this new system

## Phase Status
**Current Phase:** Phase 0 (Foundation & Database Setup) 
**Progress:** Core foundation complete, learning operational workflow
**Next Milestone:** Validate deployment works, get GPT review of implementation plan

## Notes
- **Learning day:** Piloting new agent memory and GPT integration systems
- Working in reverse order to understand how all pieces connect
- GitHub backup and GPT integration successfully established
- This workflow experimentation will inform future development approach
