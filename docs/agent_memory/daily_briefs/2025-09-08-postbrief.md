# Daily Postbrief: September 8, 2025

## ✅ Completed Today
- Phase 7A-1: Schema & Strategy Lock-in → COMPLETE  
  - Hybrid totals strategy (real-time current stats + stored monthly aggregates) implemented  
  - `run_totals` schema created with indexes, constraints, and cross-DB compatibility  
  - Forward/rollback migrations tested with zero corruption  
- Phase 7A-2: Aggregation & Reconciliation → COMPLETE  
  - Aggregate recomputation + nightly reconciliation job implemented  
  - `reconciliation_log` table created, correlation IDs tracked  
  - Performance: ~65ms/user → <0.018 hours for 1000 users  
- Phase 7A-3 rewritten into lighter version (API, caching, migration without overkill perf requirements)  
- Phase 7B rewritten into **7B-Lite: Minimal Observability** (health endpoint + structured logs only)  
- Phase 7C broken down into **sub-phases (7C-1 → 7C-4)** for manageable frontend integration  
- Patch Plan added between 7C-1 and 7C-2 for schema validation + migrations (step-by-step recovery procedure)  
- Schema verification: confirmed `day_marks` table missing → identified as root cause for 500 errors  
- File organization fixed: created `docs/phase_artifacts/` and moved phase-specific outputs  
- ADR-2025-09-08: Doc Organization Rule added → enshrines new structure  
- Playbook updated: Right-Sizing Implementation Plans + File Organization Rule  
- Bug Journal updated with entries for:  
  - Missing `day_marks` schema issue (unresolved at time of entry)  
  - Doc sprawl problem (resolved with new folder + ADR)

## 🧠 Decisions Made
- ✅ Totals strategy locked in as **hybrid** (real-time + monthly aggregates)  
- ✅ Aggregation job + reconciliation logging required, but scaled down for small user base  
- ✅ Observability scaled back to 7B-Lite (logs + health endpoint only)  
- ✅ Frontend broken into sub-phases for incremental testing  
- ✅ Introduced new rule: "Always schema-check before new phases"  
- ✅ ADR-2025-09-08 adopted → permanent doc organization policy  
- ✅ Playbook rules expanded → right-sizing phases for ~100–500 user base  

## 🐛 Issues Found + Resolutions
- ❌ Internal server error on day marking → traced to missing `day_marks` schema (pending fix)  
- ❌ Doc sprawl in `agent_memory/` → fixed via new `docs/phase_artifacts/` + ADR  
- ❌ Replit repeatedly overwrote `replit.md` → rolled back, new rule: never overwrite, only append/prepend  

## 📚 Knowledge Updates
- New schema testing scripts created for `run_totals` table  
- Patch Plan documented in v2.md for schema validation + migrations  
- Playbooks updated:  
  - Right-Sizing Implementation Plans  
  - File Organization Rule  
  - API Validation Checklist (from prior day)  
- ADR-2025-09-08: Doc Organization Rule created  

## 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Phase 6X + 6E-Lite complete (V2 cutover live in production)  
- ✅ Phase 7A-1 + 7A-2 complete, schema + reconciliation implemented  
- ⚠️ Phase 7A-3 pending (API + caching implementation)  
- ⚠️ Phase 7B-Lite pending (minimal observability)  
- ⚠️ Phase 7C broken into manageable sub-phases, schema patch required before proceeding  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Run Patch Plan → fix missing `day_marks` table (blocking frontend day marking + Phase 7C-2+)  
- Implement Phase 7A-3 (totals API + caching)  
- Implement Phase 7B-Lite (logging + health check validation)  
- Begin Phase 7C-1 → totals UI integration
