# Daily Postbrief - September 3, 2025

## **✅ Completed Today**

**Phase 4B (Calendar API Integration) - COMPLETE**

- ✅ **API Integration:** Calendar loads marked days from backend API on page load
- ✅ **Month Navigation:** Navigation triggers automatic API calls with proper month parameters  
- ✅ **Loading States:** Visible loading indicators during data fetching operations
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for authentication, network, and server issues
- ✅ **Visual Indicator Verification:** Confirmed marked days display with proper CSS styling and visual dots
- ✅ **Data Verification:** Confirmed API returns correct marked dates per month with real database data
- ✅ **Network Verification:** Verified month navigation triggers distinct API calls to `/api/calendar`

**Evidence Collected:**
```bash
# API Integration Working
curl -b cookies.txt /api/calendar?month=2025-06
{"month":"2025-06","markedDates":["2025-06-15","2025-06-01"],"count":2}

# Month Navigation Working  
curl -b cookies.txt /api/calendar?month=2025-07
{"month":"2025-07","markedDates":[],"count":0}
```

## **🧠 Decisions Made**

**No Major Architectural Decisions Today**
- Phase 4B was largely already implemented from previous work
- Used existing API patterns and error handling approaches
- No new ADRs required - leveraged established infrastructure

## **🐛 Issues Found + Resolutions**

### **Calendar Error Handling Enhancement - RESOLVED ✅**
**Issue:** Calendar API errors only logged to console.error, providing no user feedback when data loading failed, authentication expired, or network issues occurred during month navigation

**Root Cause:** Missing error state management in CalendarGrid component - API errors were caught but only logged, not displayed to users

**Resolution:**
1. Added error state management: `const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)`
2. Enhanced API error handling with user-friendly messages
3. Added network error handling with try/catch blocks
4. Implemented error UI display with proper styling

**Files Modified:**
- `client/src/components/CalendarGrid.tsx` (added error state, enhanced error handling, error display UI)

**Result:** Users now see helpful error messages instead of silent failures with console-only logging
