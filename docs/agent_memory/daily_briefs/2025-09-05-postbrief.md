## ✅ Completed Today

### V2 Implementation Plan Creation & Refinement - COMPLETE

**Implementation Plan v2 - Potato Runs & Totals Tracking Created**
- ✅ **Complete v2.md Plan Created**: Comprehensive 7-phase plan for runs and totals tracking (Phase 0 through Phase 6F)
- ✅ **Spike/Research Phase 0**: Added explicit research phase for rules definition and data model validation before database changes
- ✅ **Database Schema Design**: Designed runs table with user_id, start_date, end_date, day_count, active columns
- ✅ **Feature Flag Integration**: All functionality gated behind `ff.potato.runs_v2` (default OFF) with safe rollout strategy
- ✅ **API Endpoint Planning**: Detailed GET /api/runs and GET /api/stats endpoints with authentication and pagination
- ✅ **UI Integration Strategy**: Dashboard integration, run history views, and visual indicators for active runs

**Terminology Consistency & MVP Scope Refinement**
- ✅ **Terminology Standardization**: Replaced all "streak" references with "run/runs" terminology throughout document
- ✅ **Performance Target Unification**: Standardized all performance requirements to "<500ms response time for API endpoints"
- ✅ **Gamification Removal**: Eliminated badges, awards, celebrations, and achievement system references for MVP focus
- ✅ **Schema Enhancement**: Added `active` boolean column to runs table definition and verification steps
- ✅ **MVP Scope Tightening**: Removed sharing functionality, focused on core total days and current run tracking

**Documentation Organization**
- ✅ **Production Notes Added**: Updated replit.md with deployment context, auto-deployment procedures, and pre-deployment checklist
- ✅ **Playbooks Reference**: Added operational playbooks link to replit.md for developer guidance
- ✅ **Phase Structure**: Created testable exit criteria, evidence collection, and rollback plans for all phases

## 🧠 Decisions Made

### V2 Implementation Strategy
- **Decision**: Use phase-gated approach with explicit Phase 0 spike for research and validation
- **Rationale**: Prevents database changes before algorithm validation and edge case testing
- **Benefit**: Reduces implementation risk and ensures solid foundation before development

### Data Model Architecture
- **Decision**: Dedicated runs table vs adding columns to users table
- **Schema**: `runs(id, user_id, start_date, end_date, day_count, active)` with foreign key to users
- **Rationale**: Supports multiple runs per user, historical tracking, and future scalability
- **Performance**: Indexed for efficient queries with <500ms response time requirement

### Feature Flag Strategy
- **Decision**: New feature flag `ff.potato.runs_v2` (default OFF) separate from v1 flag
- **Rollout**: Gradual activation with instant disable capability for production safety
- **Integration**: All phases gated behind feature flag for controlled release

### MVP Scope Definition
- **Decision**: Remove all gamification elements (badges, awards, celebrations, sharing)
- **Focus**: Core functionality only - total days tracked and current run length display
- **Rationale**: Simplifies initial implementation, reduces complexity, faster time to value

## 🐛 Issues Found + Resolutions

### Implementation Plan Consistency Issues - RESOLVED ✅

**Issue 1: Inconsistent Terminology Usage**
- **Symptom**: Mixed use of "streaks" and "runs" throughout v2.md plan
- **Root Cause**: Initial draft used generic terminology without standardization
- **Resolution**: Systematic replacement of all "streak" references with "run/runs"
- **Files**: `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/v2.md`

**Issue 2: Multiple Performance Targets**
- **Symptom**: Different response time requirements (100ms, 50ms, 500ms) in various phases
- **Root Cause**: Copy-paste from different sections without unification
- **Resolution**: Standardized all performance targets to "<500ms response time for API endpoints"
- **Impact**: Consistent performance expectations across all phases

**Issue 3: Gamification Scope Creep**
- **Symptom**: Achievement systems, badges, and celebrations included in MVP plan
- **Root Cause**: Feature completeness vs MVP scope confusion
- **Resolution**: Removed all gamification references, focused on core tracking functionality
- **Result**: Cleaner MVP scope with total days and current run tracking only

**Issue 4: Incomplete Database Schema**
- **Symptom**: Missing `active` boolean column in runs table definition
- **Root Cause**: Initial schema design incomplete
- **Resolution**: Added `active` column and updated verification steps in Phase 6A
- **Enhancement**: Supports run state tracking (active vs completed runs)

## 📚 Knowledge Updates

### Documentation Files Updated

**1. `docs/agent_memory/imp_plans/v2.md` - CREATED**
- Complete 7-phase implementation plan for runs and totals tracking
- Phase 0: Spike & Research - Rules definition and data model validation
- Phase 6A: Database Foundations - Runs table schema with active column
- Phase 6B: Inline Run Calculation - Real-time run updates with day marking
- Phase 6C: API Endpoints - /api/runs and /api/stats with authentication
- Phase 6D: Dashboard Integration - UI display of runs statistics
- Phase 6E: Run History Enhancement - Comprehensive run history and longest run
- Phase 6F: Performance Optimization - Production readiness and caching

**2. `replit.md` - UPDATED**
- Added "Production Notes" section with deployment procedures and pre-deployment checklist
- Added playbooks reference link at bottom for operational guidance
- Enhanced documentation structure for production context

### Technical Architecture Documented

**Runs Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  start_date DATE NOT NULL,
  end_date DATE NOT NULL, 
  day_count INTEGER NOT NULL,
  active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);
```

**API Endpoints Design:**
```bash
GET /api/runs          # User's run history with pagination
GET /api/stats         # Total days, current run, longest run
# Returns: {"totalDays": 5, "currentRun": 3, "longestRun": 4}
```

**Feature Flag Structure:**
```bash
ff.potato.runs_v2=false  # Default OFF
# Gradual rollout: internal → segments → full activation
```

## 📊 Current Status

### V1 Foundation (Prerequisite for V2)
- ✅ **Phase 1-4 Complete**: Authentication, calendar API, frontend interface, day marking

- ✅ **Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL database, feature flags, security headers, rate limiting

### V2 Implementation Plan Status
- ✅ **Planning Phase**: Complete implementation plan with 7 phases documented
- ✅ **Architecture Design**: Runs table schema, API endpoints, UI integration strategy
- ✅ **Feature Flag Strategy**: New ff.potato.runs_v2 flag with rollout procedures
- ✅ **MVP Scope**: Focused on total days and current run tracking (no gamification)

### Database Design Readiness
- **Current State**: V1 tables operational (users, day_marks, click_events)
- **V2 Addition**: Runs table design complete with active column for state tracking
- **Integration**: Foreign key relationships and indexing strategy documented

### Performance Requirements
- **Standardized Target**: <500ms response time for all API endpoints

- **Scalability**: Database indexing and caching strategies planned for Phase 6F

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (User Decision Required)
1. **V2 Implementation Decision**: User approval needed to begin Phase 0 (Spike & Research)
2. **Feature Flag Setup**: Create ff.potato.runs_v2 environment variable in Replit Secrets
3. **Phase 0 Execution**: Begin rules definition and data model validation if approved

### Phase 0: Spike & Research Preparation
- **Run Calculation Rules**: Define consecutive day logic, timezone handling, gap filling
- **Data Model Validation**: Test runs table approach vs users table columns
- **Algorithm Design**: Create run lifecycle logic (start, extend, merge, end scenarios)
- **Edge Case Testing**: Month boundaries, leap years, timezone transitions

### V2 Development Planning
- **Phase 6A Ready**: Database schema creation with active column and constraints
- **API Design**: Endpoints specification complete for /api/runs and /api/stats
- **UI Integration**: Dashboard statistics component and run history views planned
- **Performance**: <500ms response time monitoring and optimization strategy

### Long-term V2 Goals
- **Production Rollout**: Feature flag strategy for safe v2 activation
- **User Experience**: Total days and current run tracking in calendar interface
- **Historical Data**: Run history and longest run achievement tracking
- **Performance**: Optimized run calculations with caching and indexing
