# 📋 Daily Postbrief — 2025-09-10

## ✅ What Happened
- Investigated September 8th "500 Internal Server Error" on day marking.
- Ran multiple Replit validation prompts to test server lifecycle, schema, and environment behavior.
- Determined root cause was **not application code or schema** but **Replit environment limitation**:
  - Background processes are killed in agent workflows.
  - External proxy fails (502) when no persistent server process is running.
- Verified that `day_marks` table exists but has schema mismatch (`date` vs `local_date`).

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Server initializes successfully and stays alive in foreground mode.
- `.replit` ports mapping is correct (3000 → 80).
- Background execution via `nohup` or `&` dies immediately → environment limitation.
- API unreachable externally → caused misdiagnosis on September 8.
- Schema mismatch (`date` vs `local_date`) is a genuine issue that must be fixed.

## 🎯 Decisions
- Close September 8th bug as **environment misconfiguration** in the Bug Journal (update required).
- Playbooks already updated with **Replit Server Persistence** rule — no further edits needed.
- Proceed with schema patch plan (rename `date` → `local_date`) under feature flag control.

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Update Bug Journal (Sept 8) with corrected diagnosis and closure.
2. Apply schema patch (`ALTER TABLE day_marks RENAME COLUMN date TO local_date;`).
3. Validate fix via API + DB query.
