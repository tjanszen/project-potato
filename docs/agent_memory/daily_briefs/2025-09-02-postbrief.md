**Phase Progress:**  
- ✅ Phase 1C (Authentication & Sessions) verified stable after consolidation.  
- ✅ Server entry points consolidated: only `index.js` now calls `app.listen()`.  
- ✅ Build artifacts cleaned up: removed `server/index.js`, `dist/`, and `server/server/`.  
- ✅ `.gitignore` updated to prevent re-commits of compiled output.  

**Playbook Update:**  
- Added new entry: **Server Cleanup & Git Hygiene**  
  - Ensures only one entry point binds ports  
  - Defines cleanup targets for `.gitignore`  
  - Provides verification checklist for avoiding future `EADDRINUSE` errors  

**Evidence Collected:**  
- Logs: `Server running on port 3000`  
- `/health` returns 200 JSON with `status: "ok"`  
- Database shows test users intact after consolidation  
- `.gitignore` includes new cleanup targets  
- Playbook updated in `docs/agent_memory/playbooks.md`  

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue Phase 1D: User Profile & Integration  
- Prepare ADR or notes for session lifetime defaults (currently 24h)  
- Begin planning Phase 2 (Calendar API & UI) once Phase 1 is fully stable
