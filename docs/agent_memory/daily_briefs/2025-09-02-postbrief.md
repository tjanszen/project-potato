# Daily Postbrief - September 2, 2025

## **Phase Progress:**  
- ✅ **Phase 1C (Authentication & Sessions)** verified stable after server consolidation
- ✅ **Phase 1D (User Profile & Integration)** - COMPLETED  
  - Implemented `requireAuthentication` middleware for protected routes
  - Created `/api/me` endpoint with user profile data retrieval
  - Added session validation and edge case handling
  - Successfully tested complete signup → login → profile access flow
- ✅ **Phase 2 Planning** - Restructured into manageable sub-phases (2A-2E)

## **Infrastructure Improvements:**
- ✅ **Server Consolidation:** Eliminated 6 duplicate `app.listen()` calls, now only `index.js` binds port
- ✅ **Build Cleanup:** Removed compiled artifacts (`server/index.js`, `dist/`, `server/server/`)
- ✅ **Git Hygiene:** Created `.gitignore` with cleanup targets to prevent future build artifact commits
- ✅ **Architecture Documentation:** Added **Server Cleanup & Git Hygiene** playbook

## **Documentation & Planning:**
- ✅ **Fast Follow Documentation:** Created `docs/agent_memory/fast_follows/ff_v1.md` with 6 authentication enhancements
- ✅ **Phase 2 Sub-Phase Breakdown:** Split monolithic Phase 2 into focused sub-phases:
  - **2A:** Calendar Retrieval API  
  - **2B:** Day Marking API
  - **2C:** Timezone-Aware Validation
  - **2D:** Idempotency & Constraints  
  - **2E:** Event Logging
- ✅ **Implementation Plan Updated:** Each sub-phase has specific exit criteria and rollback plans

## **Evidence Collected:**
- **Server Stability:** Clean startup logs `Server running on port 3000`, no port conflicts
- **Phase 1D Verification:** 
  - Database user: `phase1d@test.com` successfully created and tested
  - Authentication flow: signup → login → `/api/me` profile access working
  - Security: Unauthenticated requests properly return 401 errors
- **Documentation Quality:** All playbooks and fast follows properly formatted and organized

## **Phase 2 Implementation Completed:**
- ✅ **Phase 2C (Timezone-Aware Validation)** - COMPLETED
  - Implemented user timezone retrieval from database in day marking endpoint
  - Added timezone-aware "today" calculation using user's specific timezone
  - Updated date boundary validation to use user's local timezone instead of server time
  - Enhanced error messages to include timezone context and user's local "today"
  - Successfully tested timezone validation with America/New_York timezone
- ✅ **Phase 2D (Idempotency & Constraints)** - COMPLETED  
  - Verified existing database constraints enforce uniqueness on (user_id, date)
  - Confirmed ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE logic handles duplicate attempts gracefully
  - Tested multiple marking attempts for same date - all handled as no-ops
  - Database prevents duplicate entries automatically with proper idempotent behavior
- ✅ **Phase 2E (Event Logging)** - COMPLETED
  - Implemented comprehensive event logging in `click_events` table for all marking attempts
  - Added rich event data: userId, date, userTimezone, userLocalDate, timestamps
  - Created `/api/events` endpoint for event retrieval and debugging
  - Verified both successful AND duplicate attempts create audit trail entries
  - Non-blocking design ensures event logging failures don't block day marking operations

## **Evidence Collected Today:**
- **Timezone Validation:** Future date validation now uses user's timezone (America/New_York)
- **Idempotency Testing:** Multiple requests to same date return existing record with updated timestamp
- **Event Logging:** 3 events captured showing complete audit trail with proper ordering and rich data
- **API Testing:** All endpoints tested using browser console with fetch() commands

## **Current Status:**
- **Phase 1 (Authentication System):** ✅ COMPLETE - All sub-phases (1A-1D) operational
- **Phase 2 (Calendar API):** ✅ COMPLETE - All sub-phases (2C, 2D, 2E) operational
- **Infrastructure:** ✅ STABLE - Clean architecture with single entry point and comprehensive audit trail

## **Next Steps:**
- **Phase 2 Integration:** Consider Phase 2A (Calendar Retrieval) and 2B (Day Marking) verification if needed
- **Phase 3 Planning:** Begin frontend calendar interface implementation
- **Session Management:** Consider implementing logout endpoint (Fast Follow #2)  
- **Production Planning:** Evaluate Phase 5 requirements for feature flag activation
