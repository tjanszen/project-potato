# Daily Postbrief - September 7, 2025

## ✅ Completed Today

### Phase 6X: V2 Endpoints & Storage Implementation - COMPLETE
**TypeScript & Config Resolution**
- ✅ Added root-level tsconfig.json and fixed all compilation errors
- ✅ Installed missing dependencies (@neondatabase/serverless, ws, type declarations)
- ✅ Fixed schema mismatch (passwordHash consistency across code + schema)
- ✅ Resolved 15+ Drizzle ORM type errors in storage.ts
- ✅ Confirmed clean `npx tsc --noEmit` build

**Production Server Integration**
- ✅ Integrated V2 endpoints into production server (index.js)
- ✅ Corrected Express port binding (uses process.env.PORT || 3000)
- ✅ Verified server remains running and bound with logging
- ✅ Implemented error handling with try/catch + logging

**Endpoint Validation**
- ✅ GET /api/v2/runs → returns authenticated runs + pagination structure
- ✅ GET /api/v2/totals → returns totals JSON { total_days, longest_run, current_run }
- ✅ GET /health/runs → returns { healthy: true, timestamp }
- ✅ Confirmed authentication middleware works (401 unauthenticated, 200 with valid session)

### Phase 6E-Lite: Single-User Cutover - COMPLETE
**Cutover Execution**
- ✅ Permanently enabled ff.potato.runs_v2 (default ON)
- ✅ Validated schema and migrated runs/day_marks data
- ✅ Confirmed DB integrity (no overlaps, no multiple active runs, consistent totals)
- ✅ Verified endpoints + health checks pass post-cutover

### Documentation & Knowledge Base Updates
- ✅ ADR-2025-09-07 Authenticated Endpoint Validation created
- ✅ Added API Validation Checklist to playbooks
- ✅ Added Feature Flag Cutover Checklist to playbooks
- ✅ Updated bugs_journal.md:
  - Logged Phase 6X auth confusion (401 mistaken for crash)
  - Logged Phase 6E premature attempt → resolved by re-run
- ✅ Updated v2.md:
  - Phase 6X marked complete with full evidence
  - Phase 6E-Lite marked complete with cutover evidence

## 🧠 Decisions Made
- **Decision:** Authenticated validation required for all future endpoint phases  
- **Implementation:** Added ADR-2025-09-07 + updated Exit Criteria in v2.md  
- **Rationale:** Prevents wasted debugging cycles on 401 vs crash confusion  
- **Result:** Future phases will always include test user + session cookie in validation

- **Decision:** Cutover can use simplified "Lite" path for single-user context  
- **Implementation:** Phase 6E-Lite successful permanent cutover  
- **Rationale:** No need for multi-user gradual rollout complexity  
- **Result:** V2 system is now live in production

## 🐛 Issues Found + Resolutions
### TypeScript & Schema Errors - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue:** 15+ errors in storage.ts, schema mismatches, missing tsconfig  
- **Resolution:** Added root tsconfig, fixed schema consistency, installed missing types, applied Drizzle type fixes  
- **Proof:** Clean `npx tsc --noEmit`

### Server Silent Exit - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue:** Server logged startup but exited without binding  
- **Resolution:** Corrected Express app.listen binding to $PORT, added logging  
- **Proof:** Process remains alive, curl health check succeeds

### Auth Validation Confusion - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue:** 401 Unauthorized responses mistaken for crashes during Phase 6X validation  
- **Resolution:** Added test user + session cookie validation flow  
- **Proof:** Authenticated requests return valid runs + totals

### Phase 6E Premature Attempt - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue:** Cutover attempted before endpoints + storage implemented  
- **Resolution:** Backfilled Phase 6X, re-ran Phase 6E-Lite successfully  
- **Proof:** V2 system live, flag default ON

## 📚 Knowledge Updates
- New ADR: Authenticated Endpoint Validation (2025-09-07)
- Playbooks expanded with API Validation Checklist and Feature Flag Cutover Checklist
- v2.md reflects stable Phase 6X and Phase 6E-Lite completion
- Bugs journal cross-linked to ADRs for institutional memory

## 📊 Current Status
| **Phase** | **Status** | **Key Deliverable** |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| 6X | ✅ COMPLETE | V2 endpoints integrated, authenticated validation |
| 6E-Lite | ✅ COMPLETE | Permanent cutover to V2 runs system |

**Production State:**  
- Runs V2 is live with stable endpoints, validated cutover, and feature flag default ON  
- Documentation, ADRs, and playbooks aligned with new standards

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Monitor system under V2 for stability
- Proceed with Phase 6C (Backfill/Rebuild) OR Phase 6D (Shadow Diff)
- Begin planning for Phase 7A (Totals v2)
