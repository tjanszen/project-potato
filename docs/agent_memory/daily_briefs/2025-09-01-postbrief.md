# Daily Post-Brief - 2025-09-01

## Completed Today
- âœ… Phase 1B: Authentication Testing System (COMPLETE)
- âœ… User signup with email/password/timezone validation
- âœ… PostgreSQL integration with UUID primary keys
- âœ… Feature flag system with toggle capability (`ff.potato.no_drink_v1`)
- âœ… Database validation (email uniqueness, password requirements)
- âœ… Frontend testing interface at `/client/simple-test.html`
- âœ… Replit Preview deployment issues resolved
- âœ… Express server port binding standardized across all entry points
- âœ… Working API endpoints: `/api/auth/signup`, `/health`, feature flags

## Technical Validation
- **User Creation**: Successfully created test users with UUIDs (e.g., `191e5668-d88e-408b-b067-214cfabbf989`)
- **Authentication Flow**: Email/password signup with bcrypt hashing (12 salt rounds)
- **Database Schema**: Users table with email, timezone, password_hash, created_at
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation for duplicate emails, password length, invalid formats

## Issues Found & Resolved
- **Replit Preview Failures**: Missing PORT fallback (`process.env.PORT`) caused silent server crashes
- **Inconsistent Server Configuration**: Multiple entry points had different port binding patterns
- **Cost Impact**: Debugging deployment issues was more expensive than expected

## Solutions Implemented
- **Standardized Port Binding**: Applied `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000` pattern to all server files
- **Unified Listen Calls**: Consistent `app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {})` across index.js, server.js, server/index.js
- **Documentation**: Added Express Server Port Binding playbook to prevent future issues

## Decisions Made
ðŸ“‹ **Server Configuration Standardization**
  - Unified Express port binding pattern
  - Consistent logging format: "Server running on port ${PORT}"
  - Host binding to "0.0.0.0" for Replit compatibility

## Tomorrow's Plan
- ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Calendar Interface (awaiting approval)
- ðŸŽ¯ Calendar UI for marking "No Drink" days
- ðŸ“… Date selection and timezone-aware day marking
- ðŸ”— Integration with existing user authentication

## Knowledge Updates
**Updated files:**
- docs/agent_memory/playbooks.md (added Express port binding pattern)
- index.js (standardized server configuration)
- server.js (standardized server configuration)  
- server/index.js (standardized server configuration)
- client/simple-test.html (removed hardcoded port references)

## Notes
- Phase 1B authentication system fully functional and tested
- Feature flag gating working correctly (default OFF, toggle capability)
- Database integration with proper validation and error handling
- Preview environment now stable and reliable
- Ready for Phase 2 calendar interface development
