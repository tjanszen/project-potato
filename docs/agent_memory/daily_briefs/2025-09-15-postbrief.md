# Daily Postbrief: 2025-09-15

## Summary
Focused on backend environment configuration and feature flag activation in Codespaces. Resolved environment variable loading issues, verified flags from `.env`, and aligned backend startup behavior with frontend expectations. Frontend React import standardization work from yesterday remains stable, with no regression. Major progress on enabling backend feature flags, but authentication still blocked by database connection errors.

## Key Wins ‚úÖ
**Backend Environment:**
- Corrected `.env` path loading in `server/index.ts` with `path.resolve(process.cwd(), 'server/.env')`
- Normalized environment variable handling in `feature-flags.js` (accepted `"true"`, `"1"`, case-insensitive)
- Hydrated feature flag registry on startup, confirmed correct logs:

    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.no_drink_v1 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.runs_v2 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.totals_v2 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.dev_rate_limit = true  

- Verified `/api/feature-flags` now returns flags as `enabled: true` ‚úÖ  

**Process Improvements:**
- Cleanly killed backend processes and restarted with `npm run dev` in `server/`
- Used `curl` to confirm `/api/feature-flags` responses after restart
- Established a reliable workflow for checking backend health and environment flag injection

**Frontend Stability:**
- Confirmed Phase 2.9 API Base URL cleanup working ‚Äî frontend uses relative `/api/...`
- TypeError issue fully resolved ‚Äî no regression

## Blockers üö®
**Authentication Error:**
- Symptom: Login fails with *Internal Server Error*
- Error Trace:

    DrizzleQueryError: Failed query: select ... from "users" where "users"."email" = $1  
    code: 'ECONNREFUSED'  

- Root Cause: Database is not reachable in Codespaces environment
- Impact: Blocks login/signup and all feature-flag-gated flows
- Severity: High ‚Äî backend alive but unusable until database connectivity is fixed

## Next Steps üìã
**Tomorrow‚Äôs Action Items:**
1. Database Connectivity
   - Verify Postgres is running in Codespaces  
   - Check `.env` for `DATABASE_URL` or equivalent  
   - Run migration/seed scripts if DB is empty
2. Backend Health Verification
   - Test `/health` endpoint continues to pass  
   - Validate database queries return results without ECONNREFUSED
3. Authentication Testing
   - Retry signup/login flow after DB connectivity fix  
   - Confirm sessions persist correctly
4. Full App Validation
   - End-to-end test: login ‚Üí calendar load ‚Üí toast fire  
   - Lock Phase 3 verification once backend + DB are stable

**Status:** Frontend stable ‚úÖ | Backend flags working ‚úÖ | Database connectivity blocking ‚ùå
