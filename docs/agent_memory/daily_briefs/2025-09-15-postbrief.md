# Daily Postbrief: 2025-09-15

## Summary
Major focus on aligning Codespaces environment with Replit behavior for backend + frontend integration. We resolved `.env` handling, process startup inconsistencies, and got the backend + database working in Codespaces with Neon. Key new progress: session cookie creation on signup, frontend API client updates for Codespaces proxy URLs, and partial success with CORS configuration. Authentication now consistently creates sessions and issues cookies, but the frontend still fails to redirect into the dashboard due to session cookie not being respected on `/api/me`. Work spanned backend process management, API client updates, and Codespaces-specific proxy issues.

## Key Wins ‚úÖ
**Backend Environment + Process Management:**
- Resolved confusion with `process.cwd()` by always starting backend from repo root with `npx ts-node server/index.ts`.
- Installed `ts-node`, `typescript`, and `@types/node` locally for Codespaces dev workflow.
- Added `npm run dev`, `npm run start`, and `npm run serve` scripts in `package.json` for smoother DX.
- Created shell aliases (`root`, `serve`, `fe`) for jumping to root, starting backend with hot reload, and launching frontend quickly.
- Confirmed feature flags from `server/.env` are injected and logged correctly:

    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.no_drink_v1 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.runs_v2 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.totals_v2 = true  
    [Feature Flag] ff.potato.dev_rate_limit = true  

**Database Connectivity:**
- Added `DATABASE_URL` to `server/.env`, pointing at Neon Postgres with `sslmode=require`.
- Verified `/health` endpoint returns `{ "status": "ok" }` in Codespaces using `curl`.
- Confirmed `signup` writes to Neon DB and users can be created.

**Session + Cookie Handling:**
- Updated `/api/auth/signup` to regenerate + save session immediately after user creation, logging `"Signup session created: <id>"`.
- Verified backend issues `Set-Cookie: connect.sid=...` on signup.
- Confirmed cookie appears in Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Application tab under `.app.github.dev`.
- Added debug logs for session config and session creation.

**Frontend Integration:**
- Updated `client/src/lib/api.ts` to dynamically set `API_BASE_URL`:
  - Empty string in Replit (same-origin proxy).
  - Codespaces forwarded port 3000 URL in dev.
- Confirmed frontend requests now hit `https://upgraded-broccoli-‚Ä¶-3000.app.github.dev/api/...`.
- Verified cookies set on signup appear in browser storage.

**Codespaces Proxy & Networking:**
- Diagnosed `curl` redirect to `pf-signin` ‚Üí discovered port 3000 was private.
- Set Codespaces port 3000 visibility to **Public** ‚Üí backend accessible via proxy URL.
- Verified `curl https://...-3000.app.github.dev/health` returns live backend JSON.

**CORS Configuration:**
- Replaced `app.use(cors())` with:

    app.use(cors({
      origin: "https://upgraded-broccoli-rwrgrgqr6g2xxg9-5173.app.github.dev",
      credentials: true,
    }));

- Removed ‚ÄúNetwork error‚Äù in frontend ‚Üí requests now reach backend successfully.

## Blockers üö®
**Authentication Flow:**
- Signup works, user created in DB, cookie issued and stored.
- Still redirected to "Authentication Required" after signup or login.
- `/api/me` requests return 401 despite cookie being present.
- Hypothesis: browser not sending cookie back on `/api/me` OR in-memory session store losing session state between requests.

**Session Persistence:**
- Current setup uses in-memory session store (`express-session` default).
- Codespaces restarts / multiple proxy instances may be dropping sessions.
- Next likely step: configure persistent store (Postgres or Redis) or validate that cookies are included in `/api/me` request.

## Next Steps üìã
**Backend Debugging:**
1. Add debug log to `/api/me` showing `req.session.id` + `req.session.userId`.
2. Verify whether cookie is being sent with `/api/me` (DevTools ‚Üí Request Headers ‚Üí Cookie).
3. Confirm session store persistence across requests.

**Frontend Adjustments:**
4. Ensure all `fetch` calls include `credentials: 'include'` (already patched in `api.ts`).
5. Confirm browser sends `Cookie: connect.sid=...` with `/api/me`.

**Infrastructure:**
6. Evaluate switching `express-session` to a persistent store for Codespaces (Neon-backed or Redis) if in-memory store is dropping sessions.

**Validation Plan:**
- `curl -v` for `/api/auth/signup` and `/api/me` against Codespaces backend to validate cookie round-trip.
- End-to-end test: signup ‚Üí `/api/me` ‚Üí dashboard redirect.

**Status:**  
Frontend stable ‚úÖ | Backend flags working ‚úÖ | DB connectivity fixed ‚úÖ | Session cookie issued ‚úÖ | Session persistence/cookie round-trip still broken ‚ùå
