### 2025-09-01 Deployment Configuration Missing - RESOLVED ✅
**Symptom:** Replit deployment fails with "application is failing health checks because the run command is misconfigured and not starting a proper web server"  
**Root Cause:** Missing run command in .replit file deployment section, missing index.js entry point file to match package.json main field  

**Fix Details:**
1. **Created `/index.js` entry point file:**
   ```javascript
   // Main entry point for Project Potato deployment
   // This file is referenced by package.json "main" field
   // It simply starts the server.js file which contains the working Express server
   require('./server.js');
   ```
2. **Added run command to `.replit` file in [deployment] section:**
   ```toml
   run = "node index.js"
   ```
3. **Verified existing server.js already had proper configuration:**
   - Root endpoint (`/`) returning HTTP 200 ✅
   - Health check endpoint (`/health`) with JSON response ✅  
   - Proper host binding (`0.0.0.0:3000`) ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `index.js` (created)
- `.replit` (deployment run command added by user)

**Evidence:** Deployment succeeded after adding run command, server starts correctly with health checks passing, application accessible at production URL  
**Follow-ups:** Phase 0 deployment readiness now validated - ready for Phase 1 development when approved  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-01

### [2025-09-03] Authentication & Server Entry Point Issues
**Symptoms:** 
- Logout endpoint not responding
- Server crash (exit code 7)
- "Feature not available" blocking auth
**Investigation:** 
- Edited server/index.ts instead of runtime index.js
- Duplicate feature flag middleware applied globally + per-route
- Duplicate logout routes defined (/api/auth/logout and /api/logout)
- Feature flag ff.potato.no_drink_v1 defaulted OFF
**Root Causes:** 
- Wrong server file edited (index.ts not executed)
- Middleware and route duplication
- Feature flag gating misunderstood
**Resolution:** 
- Removed duplicate routes and middleware
- Placed logout after login route in index.js
- Enabled feature flag with admin toggle
- Clarified runtime is index.js, not server/index.ts
