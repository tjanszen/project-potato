### 2025-09-01 Deployment Configuration Missing
**Symptom:** Replit deployment fails with "application is failing health checks because the run command is misconfigured and not starting a proper web server"  
**Root Cause:** Missing start script in package.json, server not properly configured for production deployment, incorrect run command pointing to bash instead of Node.js server  
**Fix:** Add proper start script, ensure Express server binds to 0.0.0.0 with correct port, configure run command for Node.js  
**Evidence:** Deployment logs showing failed health checks, run command "bash -c printf" instead of server start, no HTTP responses on root endpoint  
**Follow-ups:** Update Phase 0 exit criteria to include deployment validation, test deployment readiness before phase completion
