### 2025-09-01 Deployment Configuration Missing - RESOLVED âœ…
**Symptom:** Replit deployment fails with "application is failing health checks because the run command is misconfigured and not starting a proper web server"  
**Root Cause:** Missing run command in .replit file deployment section, missing index.js entry point file to match package.json main field  
**Fix:** Created index.js entry point file that requires server.js, added `run = "node index.js"` to .replit deployment configuration  
**Evidence:** Deployment succeeded after adding run command, server starts correctly with health checks passing  
**Follow-ups:** Phase 0 deployment readiness now validated - ready for Phase 1 development when approved  
**Resolution Date:** 2025-09-01
